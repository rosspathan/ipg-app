# üì± Mobile APK Setup Guide - I-SMART Exchange

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. Safe Area / Overlapping with System Buttons ‚úì
**Status:** FIXED

**What was done:**
- Updated `viewport` meta tag with `viewport-fit=cover`
- Added proper safe area insets to bottom navigation
- Configured Capacitor for iOS and Android safe areas
- Updated `capacitor.config.ts` with proper settings

**To apply:**

### 2. Deep Linking / Referral Links ‚úì
**Status:** FIXED

**What was done:**
- Created `AndroidManifest.xml` with deep link configurations
- Added support for both `https://i-smartapp.com/r/:code` and `ismart://referral/:code`
- Created `useDeepLinking` hook to handle deep links in the app
- Integrated deep linking into App.tsx

**Supported Deep Links:**
1. `https://i-smartapp.com/r/{sponsorId}` - Web referral links
2. `ismart://referral/{sponsorId}` - Custom app scheme
3. `ismart://...` - Other app-specific links

**Testing:**
```bash
# Test deep link on Android
adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "https://i-smartapp.com/r/SPONSOR_ID" com.ismart.exchange

# Or test custom scheme
adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "ismart://referral/SPONSOR_ID" com.ismart.exchange
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always test on physical device** - Emulators may not support biometrics
2. **Test deep links from SMS/Email** - This is how users will experience them
3. **Check different Android versions** - Test on Android 10, 11, 12, 13+
4. **Monitor Supabase logs** - Use edge function logs to debug issues
5. **Use production build** - Debug builds may behave differently

## üÜò Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser/app console logs
2. Check Supabase edge function logs
3. Review Android logcat: `adb logcat | grep I-SMART`
