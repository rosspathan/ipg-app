## üåê Domain Setup (Critical for App Links)

```
https://i-smartapp.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json
```

**Verify it's live:**
```bash
curl https://i-smartapp.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json
```

Expected response:
```json
[
  {
    "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
    "target": {
      "namespace": "android_app",
      "package_name": "com.ismart.exchange",
      "sha256_cert_fingerprints": [
        "8A:E8:4F:D8:D9:86:9B:BC:29:F8:D1:51:D1:8C:0B:86:51:A9:20:6F:1E:BB:EC:8D:B1:B2:AE:DF:B5:59:FA:2D",
        "46:5D:F9:50:6A:8D:C2:6F:42:B2:A1:A1:3B:DF:7C:B2:49:BA:F3:FD:43:16:4B:96:5B:CA:34:20:ED:80:5A:4A"
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

### 2. Validate Android App Links
Use Google's validation tool:
https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/tools/generator

Enter:
- **Site domain**: `i-smartapp.com`
- **Package name**: `com.ismart.exchange`
- **Fingerprint**: Your release keystore SHA-256

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Referral link opens browser instead of app
**Cause**: Android App Links not verified yet

**Solutions**:
1. **Wait 24-48 hours** for Google to verify your domain
2. **Use fallback**: Share `https://i-smartapp.com/deeplink/r/ABC123` instead
3. **Check assetlinks.json**: Must be accessible without auth
4. **Verify SHA-256**: Must match your release keystore exactly

**How to get your release keystore SHA-256**:
```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore your-release.jks -alias your-alias | grep SHA256
```

### Issue: Share button opens browser
**Cause**: Old APK version or incorrect import

**Solution**: 
- Ensure latest code: `git pull && npm install && npm run build && npx cap sync android`
- Rebuild APK completely
- Uninstall old APK before installing new one

### Issue: Profile redirects to onboarding
**Cause**: Old cached APK or not synced

**Solution**:
- Clear app data: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí I-SMART ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clear Data
- Reinstall APK
- Run `npx cap sync android` before building

### Issue: Bottom nav overlaps content
**Cause**: Old build or missing sync

**Solution**:
- Full rebuild: `npm run build && npx cap sync android`
- Force close app and reopen
- Check that `DockNav.tsx` and `CurvedBottomNav.tsx` have spacer code
