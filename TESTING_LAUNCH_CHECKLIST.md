## âœ… Step 1: Export & Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Export to GitHub**
   - Click "Export to Github" button in Lovable (top right)
   - Authorize Lovable GitHub App if first time

   npm install -D @playwright/test
   npx playwright install chromium
   ```

## âœ… Step 2: Run Automated Tests (10-15 minutes)

3. Test the live URL on mobile browser
4. Verify all features work in production

## âœ… Step 6: Security Review (30 minutes)

**Check these items from SECURITY_AUDIT.md:**

### Critical (Must Fix Before Public Launch):
- [ ] Balance race conditions (concurrent orders)
- [ ] Order replay attacks (duplicate order IDs)
- [ ] Price manipulation (validate market prices)
- [ ] Fee evasion (server-side fee calculation)

### High Priority:
- [ ] Rate limiting on order placement
- [ ] CAPTCHA on sensitive actions
- [ ] IP-based fraud detection
- [ ] Withdrawal limits validation

### Medium Priority:
- [ ] 2FA for admin accounts
- [ ] Audit logs for critical actions
- [ ] Session timeout configuration
- [ ] CORS policy review

## âœ… Step 7: Production Launch (Ongoing)

**Pre-Launch:**
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] APK tested on 3+ devices
- [ ] Web app deployed and tested
- [ ] Critical security items fixed

**Launch Day:**
- [ ] Monitor Supabase logs for errors
- [ ] Check database for anomalies
- [ ] Watch user signups and first trades
- [ ] Have rollback plan ready

**Post-Launch:**
- [ ] Collect user feedback
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Fix critical bugs within 24h
- [ ] Plan feature updates
