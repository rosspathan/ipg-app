# Phase 1: Core Authentication & Onboarding - COMPLETE ✅

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Database Functions
✅ **Updated `handle_new_user()` Function**
- Automatically extracts email username as `full_name`
- Generates unique 8-character referral code for every user
- Initializes BSK balances (withdrawable + holding)
- Processes referral codes from signup metadata
- Creates referral relationships automatically

✅ **New Helper Functions**
- `get_user_referral_code(user_id)` - Get user's referral code
- `get_user_referral_stats(user_id)` - Get comprehensive referral stats
  - Referral code
  - Direct referrals count
  - Total earnings from referrals
  - Full referral link

### 2. Authentication System Enhancements

✅ **Updated AuthUnified Component** (`src/pages/AuthUnified.tsx`)
- Added referral code input field on signup
- Auto-fills referral code from URL parameter
- Stores referral code in localStorage for later use
- Passes referral code to signup metadata
- Visual confirmation when referral code is entered

✅ **Updated useAuthUser Hook** (`src/hooks/useAuthUser.tsx`)
- Enhanced `signUp()` function to accept referral code
- Automatically captures referral code from URL, localStorage, or parameter
- Stores referral code in user metadata for database trigger
- Clears pending referral after successful signup

### 3. User Journey

✅ **New Landing Page** (`src/pages/LandingPage.tsx`)
- Beautiful dual-option landing page
- **Option 1:** Email/Password signup
- **Option 2:** Web3 Wallet connection (onboarding flow)
- Feature showcase (Earn BSK, Referrals, Security, Daily Rewards)
- Redirects authenticated users to `/app/home`

✅ **Updated Referral Resolver** (`src/pages/ReferralResolver.tsx`)
- Route: `/r/:code`
- Validates referral code against database
- Stores code in localStorage
- Redirects to `/auth/register?ref=CODE`

✅ **New Custom Hook** (`src/hooks/useUserReferral.tsx`)
- Easy access to user's referral data
- Copy/share referral link functionality
- Real-time referral stats
- Built-in caching

### 4. Routing Updates

✅ **Updated Routes** (`src/App.tsx`)
- `/` - Landing page (new)
- `/auth/register` - Email signup with referral support
- `/auth/login` - Email signin
- `/onboarding` - Web3 wallet flow
- `/r/:code` - Referral code resolver
- `/app/*` - Protected user routes

## How It Works

### User Registration Flow (Email)

1. **User clicks referral link:** `/r/ABC123XY`
2. **ReferralResolver validates & stores code** in localStorage
3. **Redirects to:** `/auth/register?ref=ABC123XY`
4. **AuthUnified pre-fills referral code** from URL/localStorage
5. **User enters email, password, confirms**
6. **signUp() called** with referral code in metadata
7. **Database trigger fires:**
   - Creates profile with email username as `full_name`
   - Generates new referral code for user
   - Initializes BSK balances (0/0)
   - Creates referral relationship if code was valid
8. **User redirected to email verification**
9. **After verification → `/app/home`**

### User Registration Flow (Web3)

1. **User clicks "Connect Wallet"** on landing page
2. **Navigate to `/onboarding`**
3. **OnboardingFlow handles:**
   - Wallet creation/import/connection
   - Email capture and verification
   - PIN setup
   - Biometric setup (optional)
4. **Creates Supabase account** with wallet metadata
5. **Same database trigger fires** as email flow
6. **Redirected to `/app/home`**

### Accessing User's Referral Data

```typescript
import { useUserReferral } from "@/hooks/useUserReferral";

function MyComponent() {
  const {
    referralCode,      // "ABC123XY"
    referralLink,      // "https://yoursite.com/r/ABC123XY"
    directReferrals,   // 5
    totalEarnings,     // 123.45 BSK
    copyReferralLink,  // Function to copy link
    shareReferralLink, // Function to share (uses Web Share API)
    isLoading,
    refetch
  } = useUserReferral();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Your referral code: {referralCode}</p>
      <button onClick={shareReferralLink}>Share</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Database Schema

### Key Tables Involved

**profiles**
- `user_id` (PK)
- `email`
- `full_name` ← Auto-filled from email username
- `created_at`, `updated_at`

**referral_codes**
- `user_id` (unique)
- `code` (unique, 8 chars, uppercase)

**referral_relationships**
- `referrer_id` → User who referred
- `referee_id` → User who was referred (unique)
- `created_at`

**user_bsk_balances**
- `user_id` (unique)
- `withdrawable_balance`
- `holding_balance`
- `total_earned_withdrawable`
- `total_earned_holding`

## Testing Phase 1

### Test Scenarios

1. **New User Signup (Email)**
   - Go to `/auth/register`
   - Enter email: `test@example.com`
   - Enter password
   - Check profile: `full_name` should be "test"
   - Check referral_codes: User should have unique code

2. **Referral Signup**
   - Create User A, note their referral code
   - Visit `/r/{User_A_Code}`
   - Should redirect to `/auth/register?ref={Code}`
   - Complete signup as User B
   - Check `referral_relationships`: Should link B → A
   - Query `get_user_referral_stats(A)`: Should show 1 direct referral

3. **Web3 Onboarding**
   - Go to `/` (landing page)
   - Click "Connect Wallet"
   - Complete onboarding flow
   - Check profile, referral code, BSK balances created

4. **Authenticated User Redirect**
   - Log in as User A
   - Try visiting `/auth/register`
   - Should auto-redirect to `/app/home`

## Known Issues & Notes

### Security Warnings (Non-Critical)
The migration completed successfully but returned some security warnings:
- Missing `search_path` on some functions (non-critical, inherited from existing code)
- OTP expiry recommendations
- Password protection recommendations

These are recommendations for production hardening but don't block functionality.
