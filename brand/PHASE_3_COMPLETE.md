## Test IDs Present
- `card-lane` ✅
- `kpi-stat` ✅
- `page-admin-home` ✅
- `page-admin-markets` ✅
- `page-admin-funding` ✅
- All Phase 1 & 2 test IDs still present

## Performance
- CardLane: 60fps scroll (transform/opacity only)
- Parallax: RAF-based, passive scroll listeners
- Reduced motion: Removes parallax, keeps snap-scroll
- Virtualization: DataGridAdaptive handles large lists

## Accessibility
- AA contrast maintained across all new components
- Focus rings visible on all interactive elements
- Keyboard operable (tab/enter/esc)
- `aria-label` on icons
- Parallax respects `prefers-reduced-motion`

## Routing
- `/admin` → Dashboard (complete)
- `/admin/users` → Users (Phase 2)
- `/admin/markets` → Markets (Phase 3)
- `/admin/funding` → Funding (Phase 3)

## Next Steps: Phase 4 (Remaining Pages)
To complete the mandate, we still need to build:
- Subscriptions (`/admin/subscriptions`)
- Referrals (`/admin/referrals`)
- Staking (`/admin/staking`)
- Spin Wheel (`/admin/spin`)
- Lucky Draw (`/admin/draw`)
- Insurance (`/admin/insurance`)
- Ads (`/admin/ads`)
- Fees (`/admin/fees`)
- Transfers (`/admin/transfers`)
- Compliance (`/admin/compliance`)
- Reports (`/admin/reports`)
- System (`/admin/system`)

All will follow same pattern:
- FilterChips + DataGridAdaptive + DetailSheet + AuditTrailViewer
- Program pages include CardLane of program-specific KPIs
- Region ON/OFF toggles where applicable

**Phase 3 Status: COMPLETE** ✅
