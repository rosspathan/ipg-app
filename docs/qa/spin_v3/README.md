## Page Layout (`src/pages/ISmartSpinScreen.tsx`)

Layout order (top to bottom):
1. SpinHeaderPro
2. Subtext: "Test your luck with provably fair spins"
3. History button
4. FreeSpinsCard (if applicable)
5. SpinWheel3D (centered)
6. WheelStatsRow (horizontal scroll)
7. ProvablyFairPanel
8. Last result display (if available)
9. Balance info
