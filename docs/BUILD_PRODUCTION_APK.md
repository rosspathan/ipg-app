# Production APK Build Guide

This guide will help you build a production-ready APK for the I-SMART Exchange app.

## Prerequisites

Before building your APK, you need to install these tools on your computer:

1. **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
   - Download from: https://nodejs.org/
   - This allows you to run JavaScript commands on your computer
   - To check if installed: Open terminal/command prompt and type `node --version`

2. **Android Studio**
   - Download from: https://developer.android.com/studio
   - This is the official tool for building Android apps
   - During installation, make sure to install "Android SDK" and "Android SDK Platform"

3. **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (JDK 17 or higher)
   - Usually installed automatically with Android Studio
   - To check: Type `java --version` in terminal/command prompt

## Step 1: Export Your Project to GitHub

Since you're working in Lovable, you need to get your code to your computer:

1. Click the "Export to GitHub" button in Lovable
2. Create a new repository or select an existing one
3. Wait for the export to complete

## Step 2: Download Project to Your Computer

Now download the code from GitHub to your computer:

```bash
# Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows)
# Navigate to where you want to save the project, for example:
cd Desktop

# Clone (download) your repository
# Replace <your-github-username> and <your-repo-name> with your actual GitHub details
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/<your-repo-name>.git

# Enter the project folder
cd <your-repo-name>
```

**Example:**
If your GitHub username is "john" and repository is "i-smart-app":
```bash
git clone https://github.com/john/i-smart-app.git
cd i-smart-app
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

Dependencies are the libraries and tools your app needs to run:

```bash
# This command reads package.json and downloads everything your app needs
npm install
```

‚è≥ This may take 2-5 minutes. You'll see a progress indicator.

## Step 4: Add Android Platform

Now we add Android-specific files to your project:

```bash
# This creates an "android" folder with all Android app files
npx cap add android
```

‚úÖ After this completes, you'll see a new `android` folder in your project.

## Step 5: Configure for Production

Update `capacitor.config.ts` to remove the `server` section for production builds:

```typescript
import { CapacitorConfig } from '@capacitor/cli';

const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  appId: 'com.ismart.exchange',
  appName: 'I-SMART',
  webDir: 'dist',
  // Remove or comment out the server section for production
  // server: {
  //   url: 'https://i-smartapp.com/?app=android&v=20251012',
  //   cleartext: true
  // },
  appUrlScheme: 'ismart',
  android: {
    allowMixedContent: true,
  },
  plugins: {
    cordova: {
      preferences: {
        "GradlePluginGoogleServicesEnabled": "true",
        "GradlePluginGoogleServicesVersion": "4.3.15"
      }
    },
    SplashScreen: {
      launchShowDuration: 0
    }
  },
};

export default config;
```

**What this does:** The `server.url` in the config tells the app to load from a website instead of local files. For production, we want the app to use its own built-in files.

## Step 6: Build the App

Now we create the production-ready web files:

```bash
# Build the production bundle (creates optimized files in "dist" folder)
npm run build
```

‚è≥ This takes 30-60 seconds. It creates optimized, compressed files for your app.

```bash
# Sync with Android (copies web files to Android project)
npx cap sync android
```

‚úÖ This copies your built files into the `android` folder.

```bash
# Open Android Studio (the Android development tool)
npx cap open android
```

üöÄ Android Studio will now open with your project loaded.

**First time opening?** Android Studio may take 5-10 minutes to:
- Download Android SDK components
- Index your project files
- Set up the build system

‚òï Take a break while it sets up!

## Step 7: Generate Signing Key (First Time Only)

**What is a signing key?**
A signing key is like a unique signature that proves the app is really from you. Google Play Store requires this to verify app updates are from the original developer.

You need a signing key to create a release APK:

**Open a new terminal/command prompt window:**

```bash
# Navigate to the android folder inside your project
cd android

# Generate the keystore file
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ismart-release-key.keystore -alias ismart-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

**You'll be asked several questions:**

1. **"Enter keystore password:"**
   - Create a strong password (example: MyApp2024!)
   - Type it (you won't see it) and press Enter
   - Type it again to confirm
   - **WRITE THIS DOWN SOMEWHERE SAFE!**

2. **"Enter key password for <ismart-key-alias>:"**
   - Create another password (can be same as keystore password)
   - **WRITE THIS DOWN TOO!**

3. **Personal Information:**
   - What is your first and last name? ‚Üí Your name or company name
   - What is the name of your organizational unit? ‚Üí Your department (or just press Enter)
   - What is the name of your organization? ‚Üí Your company name
   - What is the name of your City or Locality? ‚Üí Your city
   - What is the name of your State or Province? ‚Üí Your state
   - What is the two-letter country code? ‚Üí Your country (US, IN, UK, etc.)

4. **Confirmation:**
   - Type `yes` and press Enter

‚úÖ **Done!** You'll see `ismart-release-key.keystore` file created in the `android` folder.

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL - BACKUP YOUR KEYSTORE:**
- Copy `ismart-release-key.keystore` to a USB drive or cloud storage
- Save your passwords in a password manager
- If you lose this, you can NEVER update your app on Play Store!
- You'll have to publish as a completely new app

## Step 8: Configure Signing in Android Studio

Now we tell Android Studio to use your keystore when building the app:

1. **In Android Studio, find the Project files on the left side**
2. **Navigate to:** `app` ‚Üí `build.gradle` (the one inside `app` folder, not the other one!)
3. **Click to open it**
4. **Find the `android {` section** (should be near the top)
5. **Add this code INSIDE the `android {` section:**

```gradle
android {
    ...
    
    // Add this new section:
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            storeFile file('../ismart-release-key.keystore')
            storePassword 'YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD'  // Replace with your actual password!
            keyAlias 'ismart-key-alias'
            keyPassword 'YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD'  // Replace with your actual password!
        }
    }
    
    // Find the existing buildTypes section and modify it:
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release  // Add this line
            minifyEnabled true
            shrinkResources true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}
```

**Important replacements:**
- Replace `YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` with the keystore password you created
- Replace `YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD` with the key password you created

**Example:**
```gradle
storePassword 'MyApp2024!'
keyPassword 'MyApp2024!'
```

6. **Press Ctrl+S (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+S (Mac) to save**
7. **Click "Sync Now"** if a yellow bar appears at the top

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note:** In production, you should NOT store passwords directly in files. But for learning, this is okay.

## Step 9: Build Release APK

Now the exciting part - creating your actual APK file!

### Option A: Using Android Studio (Recommended for Beginners)

1. **In Android Studio menu bar, click:** `Build` ‚Üí `Generate Signed Bundle / APK`

2. **A dialog appears. Select:** `APK` (not Bundle)
   - Click `Next`

3. **Keystore path screen:**
   - Click `Choose existing...`
   - Navigate to your project's `android` folder
   - Select `ismart-release-key.keystore`
   - Click `OK`

4. **Enter your passwords:**
   - Key store password: (the keystore password you created)
   - Key alias: Should already show `ismart-key-alias`
   - Key password: (the key password you created)
   - Check "Remember passwords" (optional, for convenience)
   - Click `Next`

5. **Build variant screen:**
   - Destination folder: Leave as default (or choose where you want the APK)
   - Build Variants: Select `release`
   - Signature Versions: Check both V1 and V2
   - Click `Finish`

‚è≥ **Building...** This takes 2-5 minutes. You'll see progress at the bottom of Android Studio.

‚úÖ **Success!** When done, you'll see a notification in the bottom-right corner:
- Click `locate` to find your APK file

**Your APK location:**
```
android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

### Option B: Using Command Line (Advanced)

If you prefer terminal/command prompt:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the android folder
cd android

# For Windows
gradlew assembleRelease

# For Mac/Linux
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

‚è≥ Takes 2-5 minutes. When done, APK is at: `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

## Step 10: Test the Release APK

Before sharing your app, test it on a real device:

### Method 1: Transfer APK to Your Phone

1. **Connect your phone to computer with USB cable**
2. **On your phone:** Enable "File Transfer" or "MTP" mode when USB connected
3. **Copy the APK file:** Drag `app-release.apk` to your phone's Downloads folder
4. **On your phone:** Open file manager, find Downloads folder
5. **Tap the APK file**
6. **If prompted:** Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" or "Install Unknown Apps"
7. **Tap Install**

### Method 2: Using ADB (If you have Android debugging enabled)

```bash
# Make sure phone is connected and USB debugging is enabled
# Install directly to phone
adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

### Method 3: Using Emulator

1. **Start an emulator in Android Studio:** Click the phone icon in toolbar
2. **Drag and drop** `app-release.apk` onto the emulator screen
3. **App installs automatically**

### What to Test:

‚úÖ App opens without crashing
‚úÖ All screens work correctly  
‚úÖ Deep links work (referral codes)
‚úÖ App lock and biometric work
‚úÖ Can upload KYC documents
‚úÖ All features from your app work as expected

## Step 11: Version Management

**Every time you create a new version** of your app (for updates), you need to increase the version numbers:

1. **Open:** `android/app/build.gradle`
2. **Find the `defaultConfig` section**
3. **Update these numbers:**

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        versionCode 1      // Increment for each release: 1, 2, 3, 4...
        versionName "1.0.0" // User-facing version: 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.1.0, 2.0.0...
    }
}
```

**Version naming guide:**
- `versionCode`: Must increase by 1 each time (Google Play requirement)
  - First release: 1
  - Second release: 2
  - Third release: 3
  
- `versionName`: What users see in Play Store
  - `1.0.0` = First release
  - `1.0.1` = Bug fix
  - `1.1.0` = Small new features
  - `2.0.0` = Major new features

**Example progression:**
```
Release 1: versionCode 1, versionName "1.0.0"
Release 2: versionCode 2, versionName "1.0.1" (bug fixes)
Release 3: versionCode 3, versionName "1.1.0" (new features)
Release 4: versionCode 4, versionName "2.0.0" (major update)
```

```gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        versionCode 1      // Increment for each release (1, 2, 3...)
        versionName \"1.0.0\" // User-facing version (1.0.0, 1.0.1, etc.)
    }
}
```

## Production Checklist

Before releasing:

- [ ] Remove all console.log statements (optional)
- [ ] Test on multiple devices
- [ ] Verify deep links work (ismart://r/{code})
- [ ] Test app-lock and biometric authentication
- [ ] Verify referral codes are captured correctly
- [ ] Test KYC file uploads with size limits
- [ ] Check all admin features work
- [ ] Verify safe area insets on notched devices
- [ ] Test all payment flows
- [ ] Backup your keystore file securely

## Building for Google Play Store

For Play Store release, you need an **Android App Bundle (AAB)** instead of APK:

```bash
cd android

# Windows
gradlew bundleRelease

# Mac/Linux
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

The AAB will be at: `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Run `npx cap sync android` again
- Clean build: `cd android && ./gradlew clean`
- Invalidate Android Studio cache: File ‚Üí Invalidate Caches

### APK Size Too Large
- Enable ProGuard (already configured above)
- Remove unused resources
- Use Android App Bundle for Play Store

### App Crashes on Startup
- Check `capacitor.config.ts` doesn't have `server.url` for production
- Verify all native plugins are properly synced
- Check logcat: `adb logcat | grep -i ismart`
