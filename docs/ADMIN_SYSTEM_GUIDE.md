## üîê Admin Authentication & Access

### Who Can Be an Admin?

1. **Automatic Admin Assignment**
   - Email: `rosspathan@gmail.com` is automatically assigned admin role on signup
   - This is handled by the database trigger `assign_admin_role_to_email()`

2. **Manual Admin Assignment**
   - Use the `grant-admin-by-email` edge function
   - Requires an existing admin to execute
   - Method: Call the function with user's email address

3. **Web3 Wallet Admin Access**
   - Admins can authenticate using their Web3 wallet
   - Uses the `web3-admin-auth` edge function
   - Admin wallet addresses are configured in environment variables (`ADMIN_WALLETS`)
   - Provides signature-based authentication without password

### How Admin Status is Verified

Admin access is controlled through a **secure, server-side validation system**:

```typescript
// Database function (server-side)
has_role(user_id uuid, role app_role) returns boolean

// This function is SECURITY DEFINER, meaning:
// - It executes with database owner privileges
// - It bypasses RLS policies to check the user_roles table
// - It prevents privilege escalation attacks
```

**üîí Critical Security**: Admin status is NEVER stored in:
- localStorage (can be manipulated by users)
- Client-side code (can be bypassed)
- Profile or users table (violates security best practices)

Admin status is stored in a separate `user_roles` table with Row-Level Security (RLS) policies.

GROUP BY referrer_id
ORDER BY total_referrals DESC
LIMIT 10;

{
  user_id: uuid,          // Who performed the action
  action: string,         // What action (e.g., 'user_approved')
  resource_type: string,  // What was affected (e.g., 'kyc')
  resource_id: string,    // Specific record ID
  old_values: jsonb,      // Before state
  new_values: jsonb,      // After state
  ip_address: inet,       // IP address of admin
  created_at: timestamp   // When action occurred
}
```

**RLS Policy:**
```sql
-- Only admins can view audit logs
CREATE POLICY "Admin can view audit_logs"
ON public.audit_logs FOR SELECT
USING (has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'::app_role));
```

---

## üö® Security Best Practices for Admins

1. **Never Share Admin Credentials**
   - Each admin should have unique credentials
   - Use Web3 wallet signing for additional security

2. **Review Audit Logs Regularly**
   - Monitor for unauthorized access
   - Check for suspicious activities

3. **Test Changes in Staging**
   - Never make direct production changes without testing
   - Use database transactions when possible

4. **Backup Before Major Changes**
   - Take database snapshots before:
     - Changing fee structures
     - Modifying referral settings
     - Resetting balances

5. **Use Cooloff Periods**
   - Don't immediately approve large withdrawals
   - Review high-value transactions carefully
   - Enable multi-admin approval for critical operations

## üìû Admin Support

### Emergency Procedures

**If Admin Access is Lost:**
1. Access database directly via Supabase dashboard
2. Run SQL to grant admin role:
```sql
INSERT INTO public.user_roles (user_id, role, assigned_by)
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com'),
  'admin'::app_role,
  (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com')
);
```

**If System is Down:**
1. Check Supabase project status
2. Review edge function logs
3. Check database connection limits
4. Review RLS policies for misconfigurations
